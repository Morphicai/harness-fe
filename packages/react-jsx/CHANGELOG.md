# @harness-fe/react-jsx

## 1.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 74be490: 1.0.2 — coordinated patch across the linked group

  **Functional changes:**

  - `@harness-fe/node-runtime` — auto-captured server-side `console.*` calls now inherit the request's `sessionId` automatically when used with `@harness-fe/next`. Previously they became orphans unless the handler was wrapped with `withHarnessTracing`. Mechanism: a new `setSessionIdProvider(fn)` dependency-injection setter; the Next adapter pushes its `cache()`-backed getter in on first render. ALS still wins when populated; orphan behaviour unchanged when no adapter is loaded.
  - `@harness-fe/log` — node-side emit path simplified to delegate sessionId resolution to `node-runtime.getRequestSessionId()`. Same observable behaviour; less duplicated logic. Peer-dependency declarations cleaned up — the dynamic-import contract is described in the README instead.
  - `@harness-fe/next` — `sessionId.ts` module side-effect-registers its `cache()` getter with node-runtime via `setSessionIdProvider`. No new exports.

  **Release plumbing:**

  - Republish `@harness-fe/log` after the 24-hour cooldown from a prior unpublish. Defensive listing covering all 10 linked packages so the bump is genuinely lockstep.
  - `scripts/release-publish.sh` handles the npm "Cannot implicitly apply latest tag to a version lower than current latest" case by publishing under a staging tag and then explicitly moving `latest` via `npm dist-tag add`.

  **Docs (shipping with the release):**

  - New READMEs for `packages/log`, `packages/next`, `packages/node-runtime`.
  - New `VISION.md` (three nested mission directions) and `docs/troubleshooting.md`.
  - `ARCHITECTURE.md` — new section explaining server-side sessionId resolution chain (ALS → adapter provider → orphan).
  - `ROADMAP.md` reframed around the three mission directions.

## 1.0.0

### Minor Changes

- 2019214: Version alignment: reset `@harness-fe/log` and `@harness-fe/next` to the 0.9.x line, locking all core packages together via `linked` in `.changeset/config.json`

  Background: `@harness-fe/log`'s initial Changesets minor bump took it to **1.0.0** (Changesets treats brand-new packages as starting at 1.0.0 unless explicitly minor-bumped from a prior 0.x), then the next minor pushed it to 2.0.0 — leaving the rest of the ecosystem at 0.6–0.9 while `log` and `next` (which transitively bumped) sat at 2.0. Functionally fine, but cosmetically off.

  Since morphicai-web is the only consumer and hasn't shipped publicly, accepting the inconvenience of a version downgrade is cheap. The previous `log@{1.0.0, 2.0.0, 2.0.1}` and `next@{1.0.0, 2.0.0}` releases will be deprecated on npmjs.com pointing to 0.9.x as the canonical line.

  This changeset bumps **every** core package by `minor` so they all land at the same 0.x.0 going forward, plus locks them via `linked` so future bumps stay in lockstep. Also includes the Turbopack-fix browser/node split for `@harness-fe/log` that was previously queued as a patch.
