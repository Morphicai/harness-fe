### Patch Changes

- 74be490: 1.0.2 — coordinated patch across the linked group

  **Functional changes:**

  - `@harnessa-fe/node-runtime` — auto-captured server-side `console.*` calls now inherit the request's `sessionId` automatically when used with `@harnessa-fe/next`. Previously they became orphans unless the handler was wrapped with `withHarnessaTracing`. Mechanism: a new `setSessionIdProvider(fn)` dependency-injection setter; the Next adapter pushes its `cache()`-backed getter in on first render. ALS still wins when populated; orphan behaviour unchanged when no adapter is loaded.
  - `@harnessa-fe/log` — node-side emit path simplified to delegate sessionId resolution to `node-runtime.getRequestSessionId()`. Same observable behaviour; less duplicated logic. Peer-dependency declarations cleaned up — the dynamic-import contract is described in the README instead.
  - `@harnessa-fe/next` — `sessionId.ts` module side-effect-registers its `cache()` getter with node-runtime via `setSessionIdProvider`. No new exports.

  **Release plumbing:**

  - Republish `@harnessa-fe/log` after the 24-hour cooldown from a prior unpublish. Defensive listing covering all 10 linked packages so the bump is genuinely lockstep.
  - `scripts/release-publish.sh` handles the npm "Cannot implicitly apply latest tag to a version lower than current latest" case by publishing under a staging tag and then explicitly moving `latest` via `npm dist-tag add`.

  **Docs (shipping with the release):**

  - New READMEs for `packages/log`, `packages/next`, `packages/node-runtime`.
  - New `VISION.md` (three nested mission directions) and `docs/troubleshooting.md`.
  - `ARCHITECTURE.md` — new section explaining server-side sessionId resolution chain (ALS → adapter provider → orphan).
  - `ROADMAP.md` reframed around the three mission directions.

## 1.0.0

### Minor Changes

- 2019214: Version alignment: reset `@harnessa-fe/log` and `@harnessa-fe/next` to the 0.9.x line, locking all core packages together via `linked` in `.changeset/config.json`

  Background: `@harnessa-fe/log`'s initial Changesets minor bump took it to **1.0.0** (Changesets treats brand-new packages as starting at 1.0.0 unless explicitly minor-bumped from a prior 0.x), then the next minor pushed it to 2.0.0 — leaving the rest of the ecosystem at 0.6–0.9 while `log` and `next` (which transitively bumped) sat at 2.0. Functionally fine, but cosmetically off.

  Since morphicai-web is the only consumer and hasn't shipped publicly, accepting the inconvenience of a version downgrade is cheap. The previous `log@{1.0.0, 2.0.0, 2.0.1}` and `next@{1.0.0, 2.0.0}` releases will be deprecated on npmjs.com pointing to 0.9.x as the canonical line.

  This changeset bumps **every** core package by `minor` so they all land at the same 0.x.0 going forward, plus locks them via `linked` so future bumps stay in lockstep. Also includes the Turbopack-fix browser/node split for `@harnessa-fe/log` that was previously queued as a patch.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- d2b1733: `captureConsole` is now **default on** — server-side `console.*` output is forwarded to the daemon as `server-log` events automatically once `register()` runs.

  Why: requiring users to know about and set `HARNESSA_FE_NODE_CONSOLE=1` for the basic case ("see my server logs in the daemon") was friction with little benefit. Most apps want server console visibility from day one; the off-by-default was a defensive default that turned out to be wrong for the common case.

  **Opt out**:

  - Pass `register({ captureConsole: false })` programmatically, OR
  - Set `HARNESSA_FE_NODE_CONSOLE=0` env var (note: now `=0` to disable, not `=1` to enable).

  Existing users who never set the env var get a free upgrade — their console output starts flowing without code changes. Existing users who set `HARNESSA_FE_NODE_CONSOLE=1` to opt in: that's now a no-op (still enables, but redundant); set to `0` if you specifically want it off.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 0cd04d9: feat(log): new `@harnessa-fe/log` isomorphic logger package

  Introduces `@harnessa-fe/log` — a zero-config structured logger that works
  identically in Server Components, Route Handlers, Server Actions, Client
  Components, and shared utilities.

  - `log.info('msg', { meta })` from any environment lands in
    `~/.harnessa/data/sessions/{sid}/timeline.jsonl` as `t: 'app-log'`
  - Session identity is resolved fresh on every call (via React `cache()` /
    AsyncLocalStorage) — no cross-request contamination possible
  - No userId in payload — agents resolve user via `sessionId → visitor` lookup
  - Scope chaining: `log.scope('a').scope('b')` emits `scope='a.b'`
  - Silent on missing runtime (optional peer deps on node-runtime and runtime)

  **@harnessa-fe/node-runtime**: adds `reportAppLog()` method + `AppLogContext`
  type for the new explicit log path (distinct from auto-captured console).

  **@harnessa-fe/mcp-server**: adds `EventType = 'app-log'`, bridge now writes
  `t: 'app-log'` rows for `app.log` frames (previously would have stored `t:
'app.log'` — now consistent with `server-log` / `server-err` naming), and
  the dashboard renders app-log events with a distinct soft-purple tag.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- c4a1f59: feat: Edge Runtime HTTP transport (Phase 1)

  - `@harnessa-fe/protocol`: add `httpBatchSchema` / `HttpBatch` for stateless POST /events
  - `@harnessa-fe/mcp-server`: new `POST /events` + `GET /events/ping` HTTP endpoints; `Bridge.handleHttpBatch()` routes batches into the same session timeline as the WebSocket path
  - `@harnessa-fe/node-runtime`: `Transport` interface + `WsTransport` (existing behaviour) + `HttpBatchTransport` (fetch-based, 500ms flush, 50-event batching, 5xx retry, outbox cap); automatic selection via `NEXT_RUNTIME=edge` / `HARNESSA_FE_TRANSPORT=http`; `ws` moved to optional peer dependency; new `./auto-edge` export
  - `@harnessa-fe/next`: webpack plugin injects `@harnessa-fe/node-runtime/auto-edge` into edge-runtime bundles (webworker target)
